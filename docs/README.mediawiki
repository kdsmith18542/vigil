==Vigil Change Proposals==

A Vigil Change Proposal, or VGLP for short, is a design document that describes
potential consensus changes to Vigil.  Due to Vigil's decentralized governance
structure, any proposed changes to consensus require super-majority stakeholder
approval via the integrated on-chain proof-of-stake voting infrastructure.
Consequently, VGLPs primarily serve for documentation, fostering
cross-implementation compatibility, and helping ensure proper engineering rigor
is followed.

Prior to putting a consensus change to an on-chain vote, the proposed change
must first be accompanied by a VGLP as described in [[./VGLP-0000/VGLP-0000.mediawiki|VGLP-0000]]
along with providing a working and tested implementation, and the rule change
must be gated behind a voting agenda which ensures the stakeholders are
provided with the opportunity to vote to accept or reject the change.

It is important to note that VGLPs are the end result of a process that begins
with the Vigil off-chain proposal and voting system,
[[https://proposals.vigil.network/|Politeia]], which deals with more generalized
proposal submissions.  It is through that system that all initial proposals for
consensus changes are brought to life, undergo collaboration, and are subject to
an initial community vote to determine if the work necessary to create a working
implementation, its associated VGLP, and an on-chain vote for the rule change
should be performed.
